This code allows you to obtain light curves and periodogram of exoplanets by connecting to the MAST database of space telescopes.
Planet radius and orbital period are easy to obtain. 
You can also obtain other physical parameters as the distance to the parent star by using the previous data and star ratio relative to the Sun.
An example is given: exoplanet Trappist-1b.
